title:  Lecture 1 (Atomic Vectors) - Summary
---

Here are some of the key points from the lecture. See also the sample code solutions in the code folder.

* Atomic vectors have only one data type.

```{r}
v1 <- 1:5
str(v1)

v2 <- c(T,F)
str(v2)
```

* When combining different data types in a vector, R will coerce to the most flexible data type

```{r}
v3 <- c(v1, v2)
str(v3)
```
