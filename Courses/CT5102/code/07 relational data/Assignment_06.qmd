title: "CT5102 Assignment 6 - Exploratory Data Analysis"
format: pdf

## Objective

The aim of this assignment is to use the exploratory data analysis (see below) process on a tibble that you have been allocated. Here are the guidelines:

-   Pose **three questions** to explore as part of your analysis, and then generate insights from the data using the tools of the tidyverse. You may also find the package `lubridate` useful when dealing with processing dates. Any modelling activity can be simple and performed using appropriate functions in `ggplot2`.

-   Try and find a data set that you could link with the tibble and generate insights from this (as part of your three questions).

-   Encode all your analysis in a quarto markdown file, and submit this along with a PDF output.
