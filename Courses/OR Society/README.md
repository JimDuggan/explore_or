## Data Science for Operational Researchers Using R (Online) 

The aim of this course is to demonstrate how to enhance your ability to process large datasets efficiently, generating rapid and insightful results with R programming.

Outcomes include:

* Practical understanding of R programming, including core data structures and functions
* Skills in cleaning, transforming, and exploring data using the tidyverse suite
* Confidence in using visualisation tools like ggplot2 to present insights clearly
* Ability to apply R to real-world OR scenarios, such as simulation analysis

### Required Software

The following software is needed to run the examples. It is recommended to setup an account on Posit.cloud

* [Access Posit cloud](https://posit.cloud)


Alternatively, you can download R to your own device:

1. R, which can be downloaded from CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org.

2. RStudio, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) to support R programming. RStudio can be downloaded from https://posit.co/downloads/.

3. Specific packages from CRAN that are used in the book, and this can be done from within RStudio. Examples of packages are `ggplot2` to support visualization, and `deSolve` to support system dynamics modelling.

### Recommended Readings
The following books are useful resources

* [*Exploring Operations Research with R*](https://www.routledge.com/Exploring-Operations-Research-with-R/Duggan/p/book/9781032277165) by the instructor, upon which this course is based.

* [*Advanced R*](https://adv-r.hadley.nz) by Hadley Wickham, which presents a deep dive into R, and covers many fascinating technical topics, including object-oriented programming and metaprogramming.
