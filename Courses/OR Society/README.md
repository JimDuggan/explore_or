## Data Science for Operational Researchers Using R (Online) 

The aim of this course is to demonstrate how to enhance your ability to process large datasets efficiently, generating rapid and insightful results with R programming.

Outcomes include:

* Practical understanding of R programming, including core data structures and functions
* Skills in cleaning, transforming, and exploring data using the tidyverse suite
* Confidence in using visualisation tools like ggplot2 to present insights clearly
* Ability to apply R to real-world OR scenarios, such as simulation analysis


### Day 1

* **Topic 1.** [Getting started with R]
* **Topic 2.** [Exploratory Data Analysis with ggplot2]
* **Topic 3.** [Data Transformation with dplyr]
* **Topic 4.** [Vectors and Functions]
* **Topic 5.** [Functionals with purrr]

### Day 2



### Required Software

The following software is needed to run the examples:

1. R, which can be downloaded from CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org.

2. RStudio, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) to support R programming. RStudio can be downloaded from https://posit.co/downloads/.

3. Specific packages from CRAN that are used in the book, and this can be done from within RStudio. Examples of packages are `ggplot2` to support visualization, and `deSolve` to support system dynamics modelling.


### Recommended Readings
The following books are useful resources

* [*Advanced R*](https://adv-r.hadley.nz) by Hadley Wickham, which presents a deep dive into R, and covers many fascinating technical topics, including object-oriented programming and metaprogramming.

* [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund, aimed at data scientists to show how to perform data science with R, RStudio and  the tidyverse collection of R packages.

* [*Forecasting Principles and Practice*](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) by Rob J. Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos, which provides a comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods in R and also presents a valuable data processing pipeline for manipulating time series data.

* [*Introduction to Statistical Learning*](https://www.statlearning.com), by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani which demonstrates the application of the statistical learning methods in R, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning.

* [*Tidy Modeling with R*](https://www.tmwr.org), by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge, which introduces a collection of R packages to support modelling and machine learning.
